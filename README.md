## ✨ Inspiration 

As the metaverse opens up its door for an infinite amount of opportunities, we want to take this chance to explore the growing trend of NFT ownerships and the process it takes to generate NFT content. 

## ⚙️ What it does

**Hack & Troll** is a virtual online image generator made to simulate the experience of generating your personal "NFT" through a gamified experience. 

1. Users will have to log in to their Gmail account to access the image production panel.
2. Each user is given 100 coins at the start as a budget for them to produce their desired set of images.
3. In total, there are 6 customizable components for the users to edit. 
    - Hat 🎩
    - Face 😀
    - Body 🧍
    - Arm 🦾
    - Pet 🐶
    - Background 🏙️

4. For each item, they are assigned with a rarity tag. Users will have to spend 5 coins each time to roll a dice to obtain one component.
5. When the desired sets of components are obtained, the user can save their character.

## ⚒️ How we built it

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Superbase

## 💀 Challenges we ran into 

### Emulation of NFT Experience
Due to time constraints, we emulate the experience of NFT by limiting the usage of the different components.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

### We complete the app
